# ArcGIS-JSSDK-craftySamples
Crafty samples for the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. Mostly adjustments of pre-existing samples.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will automatically install the git hooks that enable automatic TOC generation. The installation is handled by npm's `prepare` script, which runs in the following situations:
- After running `npm install`
- After cloning the repository
- Before the package is packed for publishing
- Before creating a new git commit

The Table of Contents in `index.html` will now automatically update whenever you commit changes.


## Execute

Run ```npm start``` to run on localhost.
